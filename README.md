# Payblocks

Payblocks is a powerful website builder that combines the best of two worlds: PayloadCMS's robust content management capabilities and shadcnblocks' extensive UI component library. The name "Payblocks" reflects this fusion - "Pay" from PayloadCMS and "Blocks" from shadcnblocks.

This project transforms the traditional PayloadCMS starter into a feature-rich website builder with a beautiful, modern UI and an extensive collection of pre-built components. Whether you're building a corporate website, a portfolio, or a complex web application, Payblocks provides all the building blocks you need.

The docs for this repo are located here: [Payblocks Docs](https://docs.shadcnblocks.com/payload/getting-started/)
